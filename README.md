## Note
This repo is a fork of the original and fantastic [StylishThemes](https://github.com/StylishThemes/GitHub-Dark) repo. I made this copy to play with the code and tweak to my hearts content. Please take a look at the original repository if you are interested in installing this theme, as I'm not likely to keep up with updates.
